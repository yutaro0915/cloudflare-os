// This file defines the API spoken between the Gadgets Workshop service and the front-end UI.
//
// The UI is a good old "fat client" SPA. Why not use SSR? Because:
// - Users of this UI are likely to have it open often, maybe even all the time. Startup time is
//   less of a concern than with sites you visit only briefly, and assets are likely to be in cache
//   in any case.
// - The Gadgets themselves are sandboxed on the client side in addition to the server side. This
//   sandboxing requires running code in the browser. It is not plausible to server-side render
//   a Gadget itself.
// - By providing a really clean API boundary between client and server, we make it easier to build
//   alternative clients.
// - SPA is just easier to think about.
//
// The entire API between the client and server is an RPC API, using Cloudflare's JavaScript RPC,
// which essentially allows natural JavaScript / TypeScript interfaces to be exposed over the
// network.
//
// The RPC interface operates over a WebSocket, which the client starts immediately at startup and
// keeps open for the entire lifetime of the session, reconnecting if needed.
//
// Gadgets run inside a sandboxed iframe which has no ability to talk to the outside world at all,
// except postMessage() to the parent frame. Through postMessage() exchanges, the Gadget can speak
// RPC to the Workshop. Among other things, through this interface, the Workshop provides the
// Gadget a stub pointing to the Gadget's server-side Durable Object interface.
